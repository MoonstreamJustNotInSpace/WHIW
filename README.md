 What Hath I Wrought!?
WARNING: This is not a balanced mod.
Yes, I know this mod is a mess. It's my first mod, made over the time period of about 48 hours. 
Also, FYI, none of these sprites are totally mine. They all come from either the actual Mindustry sprites or from DeepScience, and I plan to change that. 
This currently contains:
1. Mobile Core
2. Unit Pad...?
3. Batteries (3000 Power as an item)
4. Packaged units (P.U.C.K.S) make a unit at one place, send it as an item, and unpack it for cheap! (made mainly for campaign)
5. Armored Copper and Titanium conveyors (don't have any more HP, but no side inputs)
6. More to come! (probably)
